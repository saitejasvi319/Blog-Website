            <h2>Hi, this is Rahul Sharma. </h2>

            <p><strong>I help people invest, save and mutliply money</strong>. Financial advice typically costs .5% to
                1% of the portfolio per annum. Not everyone needs a financial advisor. About one-quarter of people are
                self-directed and truly enjoy investing following the market and doing the financial projection, but
                three-quarter of us aren’t self-directed when it comes to money. It’s good to know that there is help
                available which can really pay off in the right circumstances. The charges, however, must not hurt your
                investments significantly. We, at savart, believe that everybody deserves quality, affordable financial
                & investment advice irrespective of their amount of investment.</p>

            <p>Actually, it is more likely an event that spooks a person and sends him scurrying through an advisor’s
                door. When you reach a point when you are constantly afraid that you are going to make a mistake with
                your investments, then you need a professional advice.</p>

            <p>The need for a financial advisor arises when you do not have time to monitor, evaluate and make periodic
                changes in the portfolios. If you are truly bad with numbers or financial discipline or have a very
                complex financial situation an expert advice might be advisable. There are certain money or tax
                management topics that can benefit from an expert advice, like the timing of social security,
                sequencing, and taxation of retirement withdrawal etc.</p>
